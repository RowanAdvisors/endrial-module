# Loot Sheet NPC Starfinder

This module adds an additional NPC sheet which can be used for loot containers such as chests. It also allows spells to be automatically converted into spell scrolls by dragging them onto this sheet. 

This version was forked from SvenWerlen's fork of Jan Ole Peek's module which doesn't support sfrpg system (https://github.com/SvenWerlen/fvtt-loot-sheet-npc-pf1, https://github.com/jopeek/fvtt-loot-sheet-npc-5e). 
This fork will be maintained separately and specifically for Starfinder
