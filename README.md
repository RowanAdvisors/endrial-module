# Endrial Module

This module modifies the core PF1 system for the 

List of modified rules:
- Married wounds and vigor, and wounds thresholds
- Custom wounds calculation (2*CON + CON-mod per level)
- Rest:
    - Restore all vigor
    - Restore 1 wound, 2 if long term care is done
- Nonleathal Damage changes:
    - decrease vigor until 0, after that track nonleathal damage counting up
    - when nonleathal damage is >= your current wounds you become unconcious
